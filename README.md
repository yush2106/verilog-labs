# Verilog Labs

FPGA (field-programmable gate array) is a configurable integrated circuit, it could be repeatedly programmed.

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It's used in the design and verification of digital circuits.

After Verilog circuit logics are compiled, the synthesis gate-level program on the FPGA development board, we could implement and verify the circuit logics design.

## Development Board
These labs in the repository use [Altera DE2-115](http://de2-115.terasic.com) to implement the circuit logics.
